    Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy and Terms of Use apply to all mobile applications (“Apps”) published by Alexander Hopkins Studio on the Apple App Store under the same Apple Developer account.
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This policy explains how information is handled when you use our apps.

1. Information We Collect
We may collect limited information to provide and improve app functionality, including:
 • Basic usage data (such as app interactions and performance)
 • Device information (such as device type, operating system, and app version)
 • Anonymous identifiers for analytics or crash reporting
We do not collect sensitive personal information such as your name, physical address, or payment details unless explicitly stated within the app.

2. Subscriptions and In-App Purchases
Our apps may offer auto-renewable subscriptions and/or other in-app purchases.
 • Subscription prices and durations are clearly displayed within each app before purchase
 • Payments are processed securely by Apple via the App Store
 • We do not collect or store your payment or billing information
 • Subscription management, renewal, and cancellation are handled entirely through your Apple ID settings
 • Free trials, if available, automatically convert to paid subscriptions unless canceled before the trial period ends
 • Refund requests are managed by Apple according to App Store policies

3. How We Use Information
Information collected is used only to:
 • Operate and maintain app features
 • Improve performance and user experience
 • Fix bugs and analyze crashes
We do not use your data for advertising or marketing purposes unless clearly stated within the app.

4. App Tracking Transparency
Some of our apps may request permission to track your activity across other companies’ apps and websites for purposes such as advertising or analytics, in accordance with Apple’s App Tracking Transparency framework.
Tracking will occur only if you explicitly allow it. You may choose “Ask App Not to Track,” and you can change your tracking preference at any time in your device settings.

5. Data Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information.
Data may be shared only with trusted third-party service providers (such as analytics, crash reporting, or advertising services) strictly for app operation and improvement, and only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

6. Data Retention
We retain information only for as long as necessary to provide app functionality and comply with applicable requirements. When data is no longer needed, it is deleted or anonymized.

7. Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access or misuse.

8. Children’s Privacy
The age rating of each app is determined and displayed on the App Store.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that such information has been collected, we will take steps to delete it.

9. Your Rights
You may stop using our apps at any time. If you have questions about data usage or wish to request deletion of applicable data, you may contact us using the email address below.

10. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the updated version will be effective when published.
